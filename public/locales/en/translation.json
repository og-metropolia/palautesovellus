Visual feedback is a powerful tool that can help understand students' feelings and thoughts more deeply than traditional texts. By drawing, students can express their emotions, thoughts, and perceptions about the content and methods of teaching. It gives them the opportunity to communicate in a different way and to highlight perspectives that might go unnoticed in text-based feedback."
