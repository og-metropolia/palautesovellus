Visual feedback is a powerful tool that can help understand students' feelings and thoughts more deeply than traditional texts. By drawing, students can express their emotions, thoughts, and perceptions about the content and methods of teaching. It gives them the opportunity to communicate in a different way and to highlight perspectives that might go unnoticed in text-based feedback."

FeedbackBounce gives teachers a clear overview of the feedback received through visual diagrams and analysis tools. Whether it's feedback from a single lesson or long-term trends, FeedbackBounce provides solutions for collecting and analyzing information. Let FeedbackBounce help you enhance your teaching and offer your students the best possible learning experience."
